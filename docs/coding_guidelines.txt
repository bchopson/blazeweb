when naming things, go from generic to specific:

# ok
def setup_something():
    pass

# don't use
def something_setup():
    pass


when initilizing something, use the "init" prefix since this corresponds with
python's __init__ method and should be intuative.

when possible, methods of a class should proceed in the order called.  Methods
called first should be higher in the class definition.
